b'travellers of various states can utilise five star facilities and roam on the large lake sitting on motorboat speed boat or house boat'
b'near pathiramnal there are many tourist spots and historic places'
b'famous nehru trophy snake boat race had also happened near this island'
b'prosperous people go abroad spending money to take pleasure of artificial islands'
b'but pathiramnal is for those people who can not bear expenditures of lakhs but want to take pleasure'
b'yes surrounded by water from four sides in the own country of god this is heaven on earth'
b'you can reach pathiramanal by air route from any place of the world'
b'you will disembark very close of this island'
b'the nearest at 85 kilometres is cochin international airport'
b'pathiramanal is also linked by rail route'
b'the names of the nearest railway stations are alapuzha and kottayam'
b'both these stations are at a distance of 25 kilometres'
b'after disembarking in zurich i walked towards beautiful and cosmopolitan city geneva'
b'this on common basis gives birth to the confusion of switzerland being the capital but is not'
b'maybe the reason of this is that the whole world like the headquarters of united nations the world health organization red cross and international labor organization etc is there'
b'all these especially the united nations are places worth visiting'
b'the best thing is this that you can roam most places walking and the rest one or two places by bus'
b'then it was said that i should definitely see an important archaeological place cathedral saint pierre'
b'if these type of things do not attract you much then you can also leave it'
b'but if you like places like these then you can spend your some time there'
b'later rp vbd to nnp nnp cc nnp nnp nnp'
b'here the human atrocities happening in the recent history has been documented in the form of films statues and sound tracks'
b'but the thing about geneva i liked the most and is also maybe the favorite of the tourists'
b'that is walking along geneva lake and admiring jet d nnp'
b'one such a big fountain lrb and the largest in europe also rrb which throws water down from 140 metres high in the air'
b'the favorite work of the tourists is to keep standing there so some drops of water spread by gusts of wind touch their face with love'
b'for this place you will not need any directions because this is seen from anywhere in the whole city'
b'from my experience i can say this that less expensive hotels are in reality not less expensive'
b'the best alternative is youth hostel where the expenditure of one night comes near of 14 dollars'
b'after deciding the place of staying roaming is most expensive'
b'the better alternative is this that take travel pass'
b'in switzerland there are many types of passes available which are the best for you choose that'
b'now also this is right that take rail pass journey of bus and boat remain included in this'
b'the price of a pass of one day is 35 40 dollars'
b'this is not some bad alternative because after this you can also undertake a journey anywhere in switzerland'
b'although geneva is not a cheap place but nothing is cheap in switzerland'
b'despite this rp vbd rb cd nns jj'
b'on reaching there once you will feel that the most expenditure in switzerland happens on journey and food not necessarily in this order'
b'even then reduction can be done in large measures in these'
b'because the true beauty of switzerland is not in miracles made by humans rather in the raw colors of nature'
b'london sitting on the piers of thames take unlimited enjoyment'
b'such is said that for those who praise beauty while walking on foot the climate of europe sits absolutely fine'
b'it is something like the same for london as well its construction basic structure and environment will signify your journey'
b'places of eating in london'
b'subsistence can be done with ease on street food'
b'you will get very many pizza huts where you can take enjoyment of meals in only 12 pounds'
b'mc donald s are also present everywhere'
b'places of stay in london'
b'there is no better deal than lancaster court hotel where of one night 35 pounds are needed'
b'although you will get other hotels of this type too'
b'how to journey in london'
b'you can roam the whole city on foot but the underground pass is available on very cheap rates'
b'and for going to distant places this is the best alternative'
b'what to do in london'
b'roam oxford university do a silent journey of thames and london bridge spend evenings in the midst of the fragrance of the flowers in hyde park'
b'take your pictures with your favorite stars in madame tussauds museum'
b'paris the french kiss'
b'to tell the truth the real pleasure of roaming in paris can be taken on foot'
b'after coming out from the lobby of the hotel will walk only a little distance that metro station will come into view'
b'from here you can go to any corner of paris'
b'the place which me and my friends decided to see first that is regarded as the most beautiful street in the world'
b'we are talking of champs x89lys xa9es lrb although the french call it by the name of shonzalize rrb'
b'here are the most expensive houses and shops of europe'
b'but do not hope for bargains'
b'on both sides of paris from luxury stores to expensive cafes and restaurants'
b'roaming comfortably we reached arc de triomphe'
b'anyway for taking a view of the street it is necessary to give some rest to the legs'
b'after eating drinking in mc donald s there we also did photography for long'
b'every corner of the store remains filled with the best things'
b'in the shops outside of lafayette we also did a little shopping'
b'stuff there was not very expensive'
b'then the convoy of us friends reached one such place which you can call a small india'
b'most people coming to paris like to see the eiffel tower first'
b'this was not our first stage but then not the last as well'
b'in the dark night sitting on a bench we kept admiring the eiffel tower for some time'
b'our some friends went on the eiffel tower also taking tickets of twelve euros'
b'it was not that there was less money with us and for that reason we did not go up'
b'we had got to know that a sight like that from eiffel tower can be also be had free'
b'so like the local people of paris we thought it better to climb the tour de montparnasse'
b'paris was looking so beautiful from there'
b'this you will not get by listening or reading but only by going there'
b'in paris you can also get face to face with the secretive smile of mona lisa from a distance of one foot'
b'it is not so that there are only paintings of leonardo da vinci there'
b'there you will also see the artwork of pablo picasso and monet'
b'besides this there is a glut of museums in paris'
b'taking a pass in 30 euros you can see all 60 museums within two days'
b'if there is no charm of seeing museums then spending just 10 euros can try to know the secret of the smile of mona lisa in the louvre museum'
b'if you have read the da vinci code then you will get reminded of that pyramid here which is mentioned with great detail in that'
b'here taking a ticket you can also take the pleasure of a cruise in the seine river'
b'notre dame louvre and eiffel tower all are made beside this river'
b'you can call les pusage de saint ouen the thief market of paris'
b'here you will get everything in very less money like the thief markets of delhi and mumbai'
b'this market sets up every saturday to monday'
b'go and rinse this market properly who knows you might get the kohinoor for the value of shells'
b'apart from this saint germain des pres les halles and rue saint martin are also such places where you should definitely go'
b'here you can get good things in cheap prices'
b'in paris there are such innumerable things which you can see and do'
b'this can also be said that there is definitely something or the other for every person and every budget'
b'you must remember my last saying whether your budget is of 80 dollars or 8000 dollars daily'
b'you will not be able to stay without getting stuck in the love of this lovable city'
b'where to eat in paris'
b'here the street food is not only cheap but also tasty'
b'in less than five dollars only you can take enjoyment of paninis and from crepes to pancakes mc donald s is there only'
b'where to stay in paris'

b'a joy like being in tune found in the lap of the nature'
b'anoushka shankar told spriha srivastava about the harmonious and beautiful evenings spent in kopanang and goa'
b'for enjoying holidays where do you like to go'
b'without losing any moments i would like to take the name of goa'
b'like to go frequently to goa and spend the best holidays in less money'
b'but kopanang of thailand is that lone place the holidays spent where i can never forget'
b'i had gone there on a holiday of one week with few friends of england'
b'there are not any telephones there'
b'there you will not get any modern comforts like this'
b'so when we reached there we had no reservations etc'
b'there you will get tree house pos vbn in nns'
b'you can stay on its platform climbing on the trees'
b'there is a bathroom there containing flowing water'
b'but whatever other things are there that can only be called basic'
b'the area adjoining the shore of the sea is wild'
b'there the cost of spending one night is just 200 thai baht'
b'apart from this there is nothing as such on which an amount can be spent'
b'this is why you can call my this holiday a budget holiday in the right meaning'
b'any special thing of this place that can not be forgotten even deliberately'
b'memories of kopanang are heart touching ones'
b'this place is known for events happening on nights of full moon'
b'there is no proper road there'
b'only an island is there'
b'for going from one island to another island there the only one support is the fish catching boat'
b'this is why when you get off on another island from one island there then you suddenly find yourself on a deserted place'
b'this in itself feels quite attractive'
b'we had set camp on just some distance from this place'
b'where happens the organization of full moon night parties'
b'did you participate in any such party organized there'
b'i like being included in such parties'
b'but by bad luck i was not at that place then when the organization of that party happened'
b'as such this much is fixed that whenever i go on a holiday then i harbor a desire of complete peace and rest'
b'any special place of attraction for travellers there'
b'there is one more place whose name is century spa resort'

b'tell about some more memorable moments which will always dwell in your heart and mind'
b'there was my room partner vicky'
b'she is my friend and lives in london'
b'she and i used to every morning at half past three get awakened on hearing the unknown sound of some big animal'
b'every night our condition remained bad with fear'
b'one night we remained awake to see which animal is that after all'
b'that was basically a big lizard found in thailand'
b'that was almost one feet long and was in our bathroom'
b'it was like our third room partner in our whole stay there'
b'in some days we got used towards its coming in the room hanging on walls and slithering on tooth brush'
b'you had also mentioned goa is this also your favorite destination of spending holidays'
b'yes goa for me is a place like that where i enjoy going again and again'
b'in less expense only holidays can be spent there'
b'for me this is also important in this meaning that this is in our country'
b'i enjoy going there every year'
b'but a few years back what used to be the character of goa that place has not remained very safe now'
b'in many matters the desire i harbor to spend such informal holidays with safety that does not seem possible there'
b'now more than enjoyment i go there with a mission of living a peaceful life'
b'for newlywed couples who want to go for celebrating honeymoon rp md vb prp nn to vb to nnp'
b'for celebrating honeymoon this place is also good because here happens more romantic experience'

b'tourists get full happiness of viewing the wildlife in natural condition and take their pictures'
b'more than one crore tourists come to see the nairobi national park of kenya'
b'tourism industry has emerged as the biggest source of earning foreign currency in india but it has been able to attract only 3 percent of the tourists of the world'
b'india tourism till now has been centred on the places of religious cultural historical and geographical importance'
b'therefore foreign tourists are given the tour to pilgrimages ancient temples historical forts memorials memorials stupas or ruins art galleries museums and pleasant cities and sea shores'
b'tourism based on wild nn vbz rb rb vbd nn in nnp'
b'tourists in india do not come with an approach solely towards wild jj nn'
b'still gradually an inclination away from historical and cultural tourism towards entertainment and aesthetics based tourism has come and in this change wild life tourism is also included'
b'the location of the national parks forest reserves tiger reserves and other protected areas in our country is in different views residing places and climate areas'
b'therefore they have a divergence and diversity of fauna and flora in them'

b'the national parks of africa are vast and no damage occurs to them with the entrance of a big number of tourists together in them'
b'wild animals like lions of africa are tolerant towards tourists while the animals like tiger living in the national parks of india are shy and like to stay away from tourists'
b'it is also a matter of attention that the tourists of african parks are often foreigners which are disciplined and follow the rules and orders with alertness'
b'tourists in the parks of india are generally local people who have not yet developed such behavior that are suitable to follow the rules list of the park'
b'therefore we will have to prepare rules and regulations and codes of conduct according to our situations to run wild life tourism in our country'
b'we need to be more alert to systematise and regularise tourists in our national parks'
b'it has been estimated that among the tourists of the country five percent tourists tour national parks and forest reserves'
b'in those parks of india that can be reached easily and which has achieved fame wild life tourism has increased there'
b'among these parks kajiranga manas sundarban gir corbett sultanpur tadowa sanjay gandhi keoladeo sariska kanha bandipur madumalaya nagarhole bannerghatti periyar are prominent'

b'the number of tourists in the madhav and bandhavgarh national parks of madhya pradesh is nearly 5 cd to 000'
b'very less tourists reach parks like dachigam valley of flowers namdafa indravati keibul lamjao pin valley great himalaya parks which are either distant or unreachable'
b'however there is no about in it that the number of tourists going to these parks are constantly increasing and in future there is a great possibility of wild life tourism increasing in india in future'
b'there for the managers of these parks it is necessary that they prepare early schemes to solve the problem of constantly increasing tourists'
b'when we talk about wild life tourism then saying this would not be irrelevant that some tourists do not lose to misuse these guest houses'
b'showing their wealth they break the peace of the parks'
b'they create noise by running transistor and tape recorder and musical instruments on these national parks which are forbidden in these parks'
b'such people inspire the staff of the guest house by giving the lure of their position and wealth to ignore the discipline and rules of the park'
b'guest houses are built in almost all of the parks in our country'
b'so as no problem of residence occurs on reaching in the park one should reserve these guest houses before'
b'these parks are often open for tour from morning till sunset'
b'several parks are closed for travellers in special parts of the year like rains'
b'different fee is decided for entrance accommodation food cameras guides passengers private vehicles etc in the parks'
b'there is a ban on carrying fire weapons inside the park'
b'it is mandatory for tourists to follow some rules to maintain the peace and safety inside the park'
b'tourism is mainly for entertainment'
b'along with entertainment historical and religious tourism can also be achieved'
b'but wild life tourism has a different objective and that is evoking awareness towards the protection and conservation of environment'
b'in this era of the deformity of the nature the message of improvement in the environment has great importance'
b'to bring this message to the tourists parks can play a certain role'
b'tourists should take great precaution and alertness while touring in the complex of the park because any encounter of tourists and wild life due to any lapse can result in sad event'
b'in this regard reminding the incident of the death of a british bird nn in cd nnp cd in nnp nnp nnp in pdt dt nn md rb vb jj'
b'david hunt reached such a desolate place in the dhikala forest range following an owl alone where a wild animal killed and ate him'
b'in the complex of the national park travel is an important part of tourism and this should also be considered'
b'the wild animals get disturbed with the dust generated by the speed of the vehicles inside the park and the sound of the vehicles'
b'therefore controlling their speed and use is necessary'
b'till now our national parks are not fully able to fulfil the demands of wild nn'
b'in some parks the tourists cell is in the core area which is not appropriate with regard to nature protection'
b'in several parks designated area for tourists has not been demarcated'
b'nature interpretation centres have not been established in all the parks for the convenience and guidance of the tourists'
b'the arrangement of stay management of traffic in the complex and photo shooting are not available in some national parks'
b'despite shortcomings in the wild life tourism attention is definitely being paid on raising its standards in which needs of tourists are fulfilled'
b'to develop wild life tourism under the development of national parks and sanctuaries project there should be a separate arrangement of financial help for wild jj nn'
